Notes|ckeditor||EDITING TIPS TO KEEP IN MIND: •Writer - Please stay away from cable channel references (exception: A&E, TLC) when compiling Trivia Quiz. Canada customers receive this as well and often donʼt get the same cable channels. • NO PERIODS necessary after the answers. Please make sure the colons are after “Questions” and “Answers”.
